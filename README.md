## Take home messages

- The biodiversity Distribution Index (BDI) is a biodiversity indicator that measures mean change in the area of distribution of species

- It uses the same approach than the Living Planet Index

- The BDI also allow to visualise changes in space - we can see where the species colonize and where they are extirpated
