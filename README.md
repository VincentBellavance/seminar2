## Abstract

The decline of biodiversity at global scale is accelerating. The first report from the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystemic Services (IPBES) that came out in 2019 estimated the number of species threatened with extinction in the short and medium term at one million. Since biodiversity is a complex concept with multiple dimensions, there is an urgent need to develop tools to better monitor and communicate biodiversity changes. Biodiversity indicators are tools that summarize complex biodiversity changes to communicate them to decision makers and to the public in a simple and effective way. The Living Planet Index (LPI), one of the most known indicators, measures average global changes in vertebrate population size since 1970. While the LPI could also be calculated for the Quebec, necessary data for it, population time series, are hardly accessibles. Hence, there is a need to develop other indicators to monitor biodiversity changes at the province scale. Here, I present the method to calculate the Biodiversity Distribution Index (BDI), a new indicator that uses species distribution models (SDMs) to measures changes in species distributon over time. The method describes the entire pipeline, from data acquisition, to SDMs, to BDI calculation and data visualization and interpretation. **CONCLUSION**
